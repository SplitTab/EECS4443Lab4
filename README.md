## Profile Photo Updater
The application uses the MVC (Model–View–Controller) pattern for clear separation of concerns. The Model encapsulates data and business logic. The View is the UI layer (layouts and widgets) that renders state. MainActivity acts as the Controller: it handles input events (e.g., handleTakePhoto()), coordinates data retrieval and updates from the Model, and instructs the View to render results. Given the project’s small scope, MVC is adequate; if the codebase grows, consider MVP or MVVM for improved testability and lifecycle handling.
